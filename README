The files in this directory are libraries. The files in apollo/ include
them and use their functions. The files in templates/ are just HTML files
that may contain variables that are replaced by the functions in template.php.

Many of these scripts, in addition to providing function definitions,
attempt to find directories on the server whenever they are inclued by
other scripts. They usually trigger a PHP error if the directories can't be
found.

The spyc/ directory contains a third-party library for reading YAML
files.
